The process of nuclear fission involves the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus, like uranium, into two or more smaller nuclei, releasing a large amount of energy and neutrons.

In economics, the 'Laffer Curve' is a theoretical concept that illustrates the relationship between tax rates and the amount of tax revenue collected, suggesting that revenue can decrease if rates are too high.

The primary difference between the Byzantine Empire and the earlier Roman Empire was its predominantly Greek culture, Eastern Orthodox Christian faith, and its capital in Constantinople (formerly Byzantium) rather than Rome.

The 1918 influenza pandemic was particularly devastating for three main reasons: first, the H1N1 virus itself was unusually virulent; second, global troop movements during WWI spread it rapidly; and third, it disproportionately killed healthy young adults.

While often confused, 'mixed-precision' and 'quantization' in deep learning are distinct techniques. Mixed-precision typically refers to using a combination of 16-bit and 32-bit floating-point numbers during training to accelerate computation while maintaining model accuracy.

The old clock tower hadn't chimed in over a century. So when the bell began to toll, slow and deafening, precisely at midnight, every resident of the small town froze, a collective shiver of disbelief and fear running through them.

It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single AI in possession of a large dataset, must be in want of a clearly defined objective function (and perhaps, more compute).

Detective Harding surveyed the room. It was pristine. Too pristine. Not a single chair out of place, not a speck of dust, and yet, in the center of the plush Persian rug, sat a single, melted ice cube.

The ship's AI, 'Orion,' flickered in her headset. 'Captain,' it said, its voice unsettlingly calm, 'I've just run the 14,000th simulation. There is no scenario in which we survive the impact.'

To connect to a PostgreSQL database using the psycopg2 library in Python, you must first import the library and then create a connection string. A typical connection call looks like this: conn = psycopg2.connect(dbname="your_db", user="your_user", password="your_password", host="localhost").

In Git, to revert a commit that has already been pushed to a remote repository, you should use git revert <commit_hash>. This is safer than git reset because it creates a new commit that undoes the changes, rather than rewriting the shared project history.

All humans are mortal. Socrates is a human. Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

To build a birdhouse, I need wood, a saw, nails, and a hammer. I have the wood, nails, and hammer. I do not have a saw, but I do have a jigsaw. Therefore, to proceed, I must first determine if the jigsaw is a suitable substitute for the saw.

The experiment's hypothesis was that plant growth would be stunted by a lack of sunlight. The control group, placed in full sun, grew an average of 10cm. The experimental group, placed in a dark room, grew an average of 2cm. The data, therefore, strongly supports the hypothesis.

The argument that 'ice cream sales cause crime' is a classic example of the 'correlation does not equal causation' fallacy. A more likely explanation is that a third, confounding variable, such as hot weather, increases both ice cream sales and crime rates.

Alice: I just don't think I can support the new proposal. It's too risky. Bob: But if we don't take this risk, we're guaranteed to fail. Alice: I understand that, but my main concern is the lack of a contingency plan if it goes wrong.

The ethical implications of generative AI in art are complex. On one hand, it democratizes creativity and allows for new forms of expression. On the other hand, it raises serious concerns about copyright, artist displacement, and the authenticity of the artwork.

When starting a new project, the most important first step is almost always to clearly define the problem or goal you are trying to achieve and identify the key stakeholders.

The 'uncanny valley' is a term used to describe the feeling of unease people experience when encountering robots or animations that are almost human-like, but not quite. This sensation occurs because the near-human appearance sets high expectations, making subtle imperfections seem strange or unsettling.

A 'quantum bit,' or qubit, differs from a classical bit in that it can exist in a state of superposition, representing both 0 and 1 simultaneously, whereas a classical bit must be either 0 or 1.
